"""TankLight, a household water protection tracker for truck-served tanks.

    python app.py demo
        Offline walk-through in the terminal: delivery, vitamin C, murky water, a pulled
        probe and a blizzard, with the light the device would show after each.

    python app.py backtest [--season january] [--days 30] [--seed 11]
        Simulated community: warnings before run-outs and chlorine loss, and a fixed truck
        loop against TankLight's delivery priority.

    python app.py plan [--season january] [--no-ai]
        The water office's 7-day plan: TimesFM (local, MLX) forecasts how many homes will need
        urgent water, checked against a simple baseline; a small local LLM (Ollama) rewords the
        plan, and a check keeps its note only if every home and number survived.

    python app.py serve [--port 8008]
        Builds the TypeScript UI (needs Node >= 22.13) and serves it at http://127.0.0.1:8008.

All data is SIMULATED; see tanklight/simulate.py.
